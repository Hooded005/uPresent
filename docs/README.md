 The main idea is that users should be able to upload files (video, audio and pictures) to the app. And from the files uploaded to the app they should be able to create a new presentation and arrange the files in any way that they want to. The user should be able to adjust the order of the files on the fly without effecting how the viewers of the presentation see the presentation, and it should also be done from the phone.
